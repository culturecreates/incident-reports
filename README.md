# Culture Creates Incidents

This repository contains incident reports for all Culture Creates products and services.

## How to document an incident?

Create a new issue using the [Incident report template](https://github.com/culturecreates/incident-reports/issues/new/choose). Make sure the date and time is in EST time zone. Then fill in all the fields in the template. 

## What counts as an incident?

Anything with customer-visible negative consequences. In most cases this will be an outage or downtime event but some non-outage incidents include severe performance degradations and security events.

## When should I file an incident report?

Preferably after the incident is resolved. Or at least don't consider it even remotely a priority to do the paperwork in the middle of an ongoing issue. But if possible do think about recording timeline information that isn't in Slack (such as discussions on a Zoom call) which might otherwise be lost, so that you will have them for the report later.

For larger incidents we will hold a retrospective meeting to discuss how things went, most of which should be added to the incident report afterwards for archival purposes.
